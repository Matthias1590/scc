Needed:
- Operator precedence
- Custom std headers
- Reporting furthest error in parsing
- Structs
- Typedefs
- Parsing arguments

Unhappy with:
- Type parsing, should just be 1 function that optionally parses a name as well
- Make not rebuilding on header file changes
- No preprocessor
- Messy code generation
- Implicit casting, value promotions, etc. too scattered throughout the codebase currently.

Nice to have:
- Warnings

After C99 compliance:
- Swap out qbe with my own backend

Notes:
- Have some set_error function which keeps track of the furthest parser error, if provided error is at the same depth as the currently set error, replace it, the new error is to clarify.
